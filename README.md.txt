Ramon Brito da Silva Santos
It take me 1 day
I liked to buiild and program another things, simple but that was not in the original project
Was challenge to organize and sort what thing to do first. Since  i had to build the maze, place elements, program scripts and so on

Android app
The scene i built is named as Ramon_Maze
Used Google SDK from "vrnd-course3-starter-project"
I added and programmed one more element ( a pink coin ), its effect randomly. May give you more coins or teleport you somewhere in the maze :D
